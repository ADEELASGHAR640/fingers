# Hand Tracking with MediaPipe

## Description

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates hand tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries. The script uses your computer's webcam to track hand movements, detect finger positions, and display the results in real-time.

## Dependencies

To run the script, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- OpenCV (4.2.0 or higher)
- MediaPipe (0.8.7 or higher)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

git clone [https://github.com/ADEELASGHAR640/fingers]
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd fingers
```

3. Run the script:
